## General R Resources:

   * [UW CSSS508](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/): My University of Washington Introduction to R course which forms the basis for this workshop. All content including lecture videos are freely available.
   * [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) online textbook by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. One of many good R texts available, but importantly it is free and focuses on the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages which are the modern standard for data manipulation and visualization in R.
   * [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) online textbook by Hadley Wickham. A great source for more in-depth and advanced R programming.
   * [R Studio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers): Interative online tutorials in R.
   * [`swirl`](http://swirlstats.com/students.html): Interactive tutorials inside R.
   * [Useful RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on R Markdown, RStudio shortcuts, etc.
   * [Code style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) for writing functions, etc.
   * [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510): From abstract, "This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill."
