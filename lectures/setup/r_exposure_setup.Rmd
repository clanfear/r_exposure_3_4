This file contains basic setup for R Exposure 3 & 4.

First of all, you will want to run the code in the following chunk to install the packages we will use.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
if(!requireNamespace("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!requireNamespace("gapminder")) install.packages("gapminder")
if(!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
if(!requireNamespace("ggmap")) devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap", ref = "tidyup")
```

If you are asked if you want to install packages from source, enter *NO* unless you know you have a compiler installed.

If you are wondering what the above code does, it first checks to see if the package in question is installed, and if not, then installs it. For `ggmap` it must install the most recent version from GitHub which requites the `devtools` package.
